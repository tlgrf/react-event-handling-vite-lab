# React Event Handling Lab

This project demonstrates how to handle user events in React for anti-bot security measures. It includes two main components:
PasswordInput: A controlled <input type="password"> that logs every keystroke event.

SubmitButton: A <button> that logs mouse-enter and mouse-leave events.
